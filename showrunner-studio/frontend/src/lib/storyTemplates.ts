// storyTemplates.ts — Genre story-engine library, sourced from the Showrunner AI
// Beta Tester Guide (14 TV narrative engines + 14 feature-film 3-act suites).
//
// Two roles in the app:
//  1. Brainstorm scaffolding: offered when writing an episode (or a movie act
//     breakdown) so the Script Creation Engine prompt can be seeded with a
//     concrete narrative shape instead of a blank page.
//  2. Seed library that grows organically — when the user finalizes an
//     episode, the app can strip a general reusable template out of it and
//     add it back here (see `learnedTemplates` in db.ts, wired from the UI).
